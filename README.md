# Auto-Window-Arranger

Do your meticulously arranged windows get all jumbled up when putting your system to sleep or connecting/disconnecting to a docking station? Do you really hate spending those extra seconds perfectly re-arranging your desktop?

Well be annoyed no more! You can use the two scripts in this repo to record the perfect positions of your windows and instantly put them back in place!

## Usage
1. Enter the names of the windows that you want to have recorded and arranged in `record_placement.py`
2. Run the script to record the size and placement of the listed windows 
3. The next time your windows are in the wrong place, run `arrange_windows.py` to have your previously-recorded windows instantly snap into their proper positions!
